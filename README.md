## Description
letAIcook is a Streamlit web application that helps you discover delicious recipes based on the ingredients in your fridge. By analyzing photos of your fridge, letAIcook identifies the ingredients you have and suggests mouth-watering dishes tailored to your dietary preferences.

## Technical Considerations
- **Streamlit**: Used for building the web interface.
- **Bing Search API**: To fetch images for the suggested dishes.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: For analyzing images to identify ingredients and text-based dish suggestions and recipes.
